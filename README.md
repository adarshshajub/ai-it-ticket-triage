# AI-Powered IT Ticket Automation System

### An intelligent IT support automation platform that uses Machine Learning, NLP, and GenAI-assisted semantic embeddings to analyze user-reported issues (via web or email), automatically classify ticket categories and priorities, and integrate with ServiceNow for incident creation and routing.
